1) My file name is "SP21_BCS_018.m", this because MATLAB asks to have same name of file as main function. Whereas, Folder name is according to the requirement "Name_Roll_Assignment". Original Image is saved in the directory. You can also give your own image with it's path.

2) Open cmd in folder where above file exists and type following command  =>  matlab -r "SP21_BCS_018('imageName.png',K0,K1,K2,filterSize);"
OR 
matlab -r "SP21_BCS_018('imageName.png');".
